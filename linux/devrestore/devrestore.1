.SH NAME
devrestore - devbup archive restoration script

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB[VAR=\fP\fIVALUE\fP] devrestore \fBFILE...\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdevrestore\fP accepts files that have been generated by \fBdevbup\fP. It
concatenates input files, and then tries to apply several extraction routines
in no particular order (GPG decryption, decompression) until it reaches a
tarball, which it then extracts to the working directory. When the tarball is
extracted, \fBdevrestore\fP looks for GPG signatures of resulting files (named
\fBFILE.sig\fP) and verifies them if found.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

devrestore - body of elder stone crumbling in my hands
======================================================
`devrestore` unpacks an archive created by `devbup`. It accepts one or more
splits, concatenates them, and then tries to decrypt/extract them based on file
contents.

```
$ NAME=music. devbup ~/Music/**
<..>
$ devrestore music.*
```

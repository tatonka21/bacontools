.SH NAME
togif - convert video to animated gif

.SH SYNOPSIS
[\fBVAR=\fP\fIVALUE\fP] togif \fBVIDEO_FILE\fP \fBGIF_NAME\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtogif\fP accepts two arguments: path to the video file, and name prefix of
the generated GIF. It will generate a name for the GIF based on the following
template:

\fB$GIF_NAME\fP.\fB$FRAMES\fP

After that, \fBtogif\fP will explode \fB$VIDEO_FILE\fP into \fB$FRAMES\fP
frames, taken with an equal FPS and stored into a temporary directory

\fB$(pwd)\fP/\fB$GIF_NAME\fP.\fB$FRAMES\fP.frames/

\fBtogif\fP will resize these frames so that each of them has roughly
\fB$PIXELS\fP pixels in total. After frame extraction, it will create an
animated looping GIF, where every frame has a delay of \fB$DELAY\fP hundredths
of a second.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
\fBFRAMES\fP

Number of frames in the output GIF file.

Note that since the algorithm for calculating FPS is inexact, \fBtogif\fP may
sometimes produce an off-by-one number of frames. I don't know how to fix this
yet.

Default: \fB475\fP

.TP
\fBPIXELS\fP

Number of pixels in each frame (equal to width multiplied by height).

Note that \fBtogif\fP preserves original aspect ratio and does not crop the
output, which means that the scaling ratio it calculates based on this value
will not guarantee this exact number of pixels. I don't think this behavior
should be amended.

Default: \fB100000\fP

.TP
\fBTHREADS\fP

Number of \fBffmpeg\fP processing threads.

Default: \fB$(grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo)\fP or 2

.TP
\fBDELAY\fP

Delay of each GIF frame in hundredths of a second.

Default: \fB12\fP

.TP
\fBQUIET\fP

If this variable is set, \fBtogif\fP won't print calculated values for width,
height, etc.

Default: unset

termdraw v0.2 to-do list
========================

Graphs
------
+ Horizontal string-value graphs (ref:
  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ascii_graph/0.2.1)
+ Allow for floating-point values (currently termdraw throws an exception or an
  invalid schema error)
+ Solid graphs still break sometimes; maybe try incremental revisions of every
  module?
+ termdraw is not flexible in terms of input formats; try refactoring

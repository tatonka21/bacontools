.SH NAME
imgur-dl - download albums from imgur.com

.SH SYNOPSIS
imgur-dl\~\fB[--dir=path]\fP\~[url ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBimgur-dl\fP downloads one or several Imgur albums to the current directory.
If no URL is specified on the command line, Imgur interactively prompts the
user instead.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB--dir=PATH, -dPATH\fP
Override default save path (which is a subdirectory of the working directory
with the name equal to the album's title) and save to \fBPATH\fP. Note that
\fBimgur-dl\fP won't create a subdirectory in this case, which means that
\fBimgur\~-d.\~url\fP (or \fBimgur -d$(pwd) url\fP) and \fBimgur\~url\fP are
not equivalent.

.SH DEPENDENCIES
\fBphantomjs\fP, \fBruby\fP, \fBcapybara\fP, \fBhighline\fP,
\fBopen_uri_redirections\fP

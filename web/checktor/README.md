checktor - hiding from the Eye of Sauron
========================================
`checktor` uses advanced 21st century networking heuristics to determine
whether its connection is torified.

```
$ checktor
checktor: this connection does NOT use Tor
$ proxychains checktor
checktor: this connection uses Tor
```

Well, that's about it.

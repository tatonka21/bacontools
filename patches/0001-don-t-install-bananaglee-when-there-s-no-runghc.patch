Subject: [PATCH] don't install bananaglee when there's no runghc

bacontools refuse to build and install on certain systems.
Specifically, current Haskell packages for Raspbian 8 cannot build
bananaglee, since Cabal fails with a "double free or corruption
error", and runghc is, apparently, not supplied for the ARMv7l
architecture. This patch fixes it, disabling the build and install of
bananaglee.

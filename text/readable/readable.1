.SH NAME
readable - heuristic garbage string filter

.SH SYNOPSIS
command | \fBreadable\fP [\fB-c\fP CUTOFF]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBreadable\fP reads standard input line by line, computes "readability index"
for each one of them, normalizes it to the unit interval [\fB0\fP, \fB1\fP],
discards lines below a certain readability index, and prints remaining ones.

.SH ALGORITHM
This version of \fBreadable\fP implements a rather naive readability index
algorithm. It only looks at kinds of characters present, favoring letters and
disliking other symbols, and does not take into account their order or
grouping.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fP CUTOFF, \fB\-\-cutoff\fP=CUTOFF
Set the cutoff readability index. All lines with index less than \fBCUTOFF\fP
will be discarded. This must be a floating-point number between 0 and 1.

Default: \fB0.5\fP.

.TP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
Print a short help message.

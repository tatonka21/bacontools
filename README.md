Tool maturity
-------------
`bacontools` has many utilities which are still in their early development
phase. Different stages of a tool's development shall be outlined in parent
directory READMEs as follows:

| Maturity   | Description                                                                                               |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hack       | Solution to a single specific problem. Not guaranteed to work correctly in all cases, or to be extensible |
| Untested   | Some extensions and options have been implemented, but no testing and/or debugging has been performed     |
| Moving     | Some testing/debugging was performed, and new features are being implemented                              |
| Maintained | No new features are currently implemented, debugging and testing may continue                             |

Please note that, regardless of the tool's maturity label, the responsibility
waiver in its license still applies, if present.

Snippets
--------
Little code snippets that don't deserve a separate tool are saved to
`snippets`. They are not included in total tool count.

What's up with the creepy README headers?
-----------------------------------------
I've got no idea what you're talking about. Looks good to me. Perhaps your
computer is infected?

License
-------
Unless otherwise specified in a tool's README, all tools included in this
repository are distributed under the general license in the LICENSE file.
